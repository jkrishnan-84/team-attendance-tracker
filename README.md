# Team Attendance Tracker

A modern, Excel-like web application for tracking team member attendance with export capabilities and easy team management.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: If Attendance Data Is Not Saving

If you're experiencing issues with attendance not saving, this is likely due to browser security restrictions when opening HTML files directly. Here are solutions:

### Solution 1: Use Local HTTP Server (Recommended)
1. **Python Method**: Double-click `start-server.bat` or run `python server.py` in this folder
2. **Node.js Method**: Run `npx serve .` in this folder  
3. **VS Code Method**: Install "Live Server" extension, right-click `index.html` ‚Üí "Open with Live Server"

### Solution 2: Use Firefox Browser
Firefox generally has better support for localStorage with local files.

### Solution 3: Check Browser Console
Press F12 ‚Üí Console tab to see if there are any error messages about localStorage.
