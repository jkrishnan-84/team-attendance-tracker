# Centralized Attendance Management Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up centralized attendance management where you control team members while others only mark attendance.

## 📁 File Structure

Your folder now contains:
- `index.html` - **ADMIN VERSION** (Full management capabilities)
- `user-attendance.html` - **USER VERSION** (Attendance marking only)
- `styles.css` - Shared styling
- `script.js` - Admin functionality
- `user-script.js` - User functionality

## 👑 Admin Setup (You)

### 1. Use the Admin Version
- Open `index.html` in your browser
- This gives you full control over:
  - Adding/editing/deleting team members
  - Viewing all attendance data
  - Generating reports
  - Exporting data

### 2. Set Up Your Team
1. Add all team members using "Add Member" button
2. Include their names and roles
3. Data is automatically saved in your browser

### 3. Export Team Data for Users
1. Click "Export Data" button
2. Select "Export Team Data (for users)"

## 👥 User Setup (Your Team)

### 1. Share User Files
Give each team member:
- `user-attendance.html`
- `styles.css`
- `user-script.js`
- The team data JSON file you exported

### 2. User Instructions
Tell your team members to:
1. Open `user-attendance.html` in their browser
2. Click "Import Team Data" and select the JSON file you provided
3. Start marking their daily attendance
4. Use "Sync Data" to export their attendance back to you

## 🔄 Daily Workflow

1. Open `user-attendance.html`
2. Select today's date (or any date)
3. Mark attendance status for themselves or their team
4. Add check-in times and notes
5. Data saves automatically

### For Admin (You):
1. Collect attendance data files from users
2. Open `index.html`
3. Click "Export Data" → "Import User Attendance"
4. Import each user's attendance file
5. View consolidated reports and export to Excel

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

### Data Separation:
- **Admin data**: Stored on your device only
- **User data**: Each user's data stays on their device
- **No central server**: All data is client-side only

### Access Control:
- Users cannot add/edit/delete team members
- Users cannot see other users' historical data
- Users can only mark attendance for current operations

### Data Synchronization:
- Manual sync through file exchange
- You control when to import user data
- Users export their data for your review
